The core of the prompt emphasizes the foundational concept of "Liquid Glass," a translucent, multi-layered material that interacts with light and the background. This material is not merely a transparent layer but possesses properties like subtle refraction, reflection, and a sense of fluidity, creating a tangible sense of depth and hierarchy. The prompt specifies two primary variants of this material: a default "regular" for most UI elements and a more transparent "clear" for subtle use cases.
Key Design Directives for the AI:
Color Palette and Theme: The primary color for text and icons should be white to ensure maximum legibility against the glass-like surfaces. Color should be used sparingly, primarily in the background to create a subtle tint that influences the overall feel of the interface. The AI is instructed to use a system of dynamic colors that can adapt to both light and dark modes, ensuring a consistent and comfortable viewing experience.
Typography: The prompt specifies the use of the SF Pro font family, with adjusted font weights to enhance readability in a layered, spatial context. A key instruction is to use a medium weight for body text and a bold weight for titles, a subtle but crucial deviation from standard 2D interface typography.
Iconography: Icons are to be designed as circular, layered elements to create a three-dimensional parallax effect. The prompt details a structure of a background layer with one or two foreground layers, which the system then automatically enhances with depth, specular highlights, and shadows.
Roundedness and Shape: A significant emphasis is placed on "concentric" and deeply rounded corners. The prompt includes a formula for nested elements: inner_corner_radius = outer_radius – padding. This ensures a harmonious relationship between different UI components. For buttons and other interactive elements, the prompt encourages the use of capsule and circular shapes, as they are more easily targeted by eye-tracking. Specific corner style options for buttons, such as "dynamic," "fixed," "capsule," "large," "medium," and "small," are also included.
Layout and Spacing: The AI is instructed to prioritize a spacious and comfortable layout. Key information and interactive elements should be centered within the user's field of view. A minimum target area of 60 points for all interactive elements is a critical guideline to ensure ease of use. Specific spacing rules are also provided, such as maintaining at least 4 points of space between interactive elements and 16 points between buttons in a stack.
Animations and Interactions: The prompt describes a system of subtle and responsive animations. "Hover" effects are a key component, where elements the user looks at are highlighted or expand to reveal more information. The concept of "ramp animations," which start slowly and then accelerate, is introduced to create smooth and delightful transitions. For user input, feedback mechanisms like a circular pulse effect are suggested. The AI is also guided on the "fluid morphing" nature of some UI elements, which can dynamically change shape and size based on context.
